Tweeting Cat Door (now with Rasperry PI)

It is hard to believe, but it was over five years ago that we created a Tweeting CatDoor using the Electric Imp.  The Electric Imp, being a commercial grade product, was rock solid.  It only needed to reboot twice during it's entire service.  That said, a lightening strike may have gotten the best of it.

The Electric Imp gets replaced by a Raspberry Pi ZERO and WiFi dongle.  The magnetic reed switch implementation goes solid state and gets replaced with a A3144EUA Hall Effect Sensor.  A magnet is placed on the door.  When the cat door is used the magnet swings past the stationary Hall Effect Sensor triggering a GPIO event on the Raspberry PI.
